# This class reads spikes from an external input source (url or local file) and preprocesses the spikes for the retinas
# The spikes should be stored in a file with an extension ".dat" and should be formatted as follows:
# spike_time position_x position_y polarity retina
# where spike_time is in microseconds, position_x and position_y are pixel coordinates in the range [1, dim_x(dim_y)]
# polarity is the event type (0 OFF, 1 ON) and retina is the retina ID (0 left, 1 right) (or the other way round :D)
